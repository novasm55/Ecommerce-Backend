## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 7 or higher)
- MySQL (version 8 or higher)


## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start and listen on the port specified in the `server.js` file (default is 3001). You can now use an API testing tool such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the API endpoints.
